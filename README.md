# football_match_expected_goal_prediction_model
A machine learning model that predicts expected goals (xG) in football matches using match statistics, player, and team data.

A machine learning project that predicts **Expected Goals (xG)** for football matches using historical match data, player information, and contextual statistics.

## Overview

This project, **Football Match Expected Goal Prediction Model**, applies data-driven analysis to estimate how many goals a team is expected to score in a given match.

The model considers various **pre-match and in-match factors** such as:
- Team form and rolling averages (xG, possession, shots)
- Opponent strength and venue
- Match conditions and player roles

Built using **Scikit-learn Pipelines** to handle data preprocessing, encoding, and modeling seamlessly.
